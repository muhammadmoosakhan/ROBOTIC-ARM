-----------------Robotic Arm Project-----------------
-----Overview-------
This project involves the development of a robotic arm with separate control codes for each finger. 
The objective is to create a versatile and programmable robotic hand that can be used for various applications, 
including those in hazardous environments.

------Features--------

Modular Design: Each finger can be controlled individually.
Flexibility: Easily adaptable for different tasks.
Open Source: Contributions and modifications are welcome.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Arduino IDE (version X.X.X)


Usage
Controlling Fingers
Each finger has its own control code located in the fingers directory. The codes are written in Arduino IDE language (C/C++) and need to be uploaded to the Arduino Mega board.

Index Finger: index_finger.ino
Middle Finger: middle_finger.ino
Ring Finger: ring_finger.ino
Little Finger: little_finger.ino
Thumb: thumb.ino
Thumb rotation: thumbrotation.ino
